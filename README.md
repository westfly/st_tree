# Introduction
The st_tree library implements a C++ template tree container class for storing data in arbitrary tree structures. st_tree is short for “standard template tree,” and supports STL-compatible interfaces including iterators, allocators and standard STL container methods.

The st_tree library allows the programmer to easily declare and manipulate data in a tree:

```cpp
// declare a tree of integers, where children are stored using a vector storage model
tree<int> t1;  

// declare a tree of strings, where node children are maintained in sorted order
tree<string, ordered<> > t2;

// declare a tree of floating point, where children are indexed by a string label
tree<float, keyed<string> > t3;
```

# Features
The st_tree template container class provides the following features

* Fully featured standard STL container interface, including standard container methods, iterators, typedefs and allocators
* Common tree-related methods, including `ply()`, `depth()`, `subtree_size()`, `is_root()` and `parent()`
* Computational efficiency — all operations execute in logarithmic time, except those involving deep copy
* Configurable storage models for child nodes — children of a node may be managed using a `vector<>` (“raw”), `multiset<>` (“ordered”) or `map<>` (“keyed”) container model.
* Compiles under standard ANSI C++
* Unit tested
* Memory tested with valgrind
* Open sourced under the Apache 2.0 License
